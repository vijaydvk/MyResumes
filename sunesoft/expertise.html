          <p style="text-indent: 40px">Inventory management is a science primarily about specifying the shape and placement of stocked goods. It is required at different locations within a facility or within many locations of a supply network to precede the regular and planned course of production and stock of materials.</p>  
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">The scope of inventory management concerns the fine lines between replenishment lead time, carrying costs of inventory, asset management, inventory forecasting, inventory valuation, inventory visibility, future inventory price forecasting, physical inventory, available physical space, quality management, replenishment, returns and defective goods, and demand forecasting. Balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels, which is an ongoing process as the business needs shift and react to the wider environment.</p>

          <h2 id="hr"><b>HR (Human Resources)</b></h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 40px">We follow the Human resources policys of the people who make up the workforce of an organization, business sector, or economy. "Human capital" is sometimes used synonymously with "human resources", although human capital typically refers to a more narrow view (i.e., the knowledge the individuals embody and economic growth). Likewise, other terms sometimes used include "manpower", "talent", "labour", "personnel", or simply "people".
          <p style="text-indent: 40px">A human-resources department (HR department) of an organization performs human resource management, overseeing various aspects of employment, such as compliance with labour law and employment standards, administration of employee benefits, and some aspects of recruitment and dismissal.</p>
		  <br><br><b>Human Resource Activities Such as:</b>
		  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determine needs of the staff.
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determine to use temporary staff or hire employees to fill these needs.
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recruit and train the best employees.
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervise the work.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manage employee relations, unions and collective bargaining.

          <h2 id="baf"><b>Banking and Finance</b></h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 40px">We maintain the Banking and finance is a critical infrastructure characterized by entities, such as retail and commercial organizations, investment institutions, exchange boards, trading houses, and reserve systems, and associated operational organizations, government operations, and support activities, that are involved in all manner of monetary transactions, including its storage for saving purposes, its investment for income purposes, its exchange for payment purposes, and its disbursement in the form of loans and other financial instruments.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 40px">The principal vulnerabilities of the banking and finance sector are physical in nature. Its payments systems and its securities and commodities exchanges with their clearing and settlement organizations are vital to other parts of the banking and financial system and the economy at large. There are few of them, and in some cases, they are geographically concentrated. To back up its payments systems, the Federal Reserve has three geographically dispersed and “hardened” sites, each capable of completing the full volume of transactions sent over its wire transfer system.</p>
		  <p style="text-indent: 40px">Similar back-up and “hardening” of facilities can be found in the other electronic payments and electronic messaging systems, and most exchanges have a variety of contingency arrangements to rechannel trading activities should anyone’s facilities become inoperable. In addition, the principal clearing and settlement organizations for the major stock exchanges have back-up sites some distance from the primary sites, as well as cold storage sites for data.</p>
		  <p style="text-indent: 40px">These arrangements, together with strong measures to “harden” primary facilities, greatly reduce the overall vulnerabilities of this sector, but there remains risk from any event that disrupts telecommunications service and electric power within the geographic area in which key facilities are concentrated.</p>
